We are doing a html project again for my junior final. its nothing even that challenging. ITS FUCKING 3 HTML PAGES AND ONE CSS PAGE. BRO WHAT IS THIS BS.
Listen i could understand if this was like 1st year or 2nd even but come on dude we did python for like 2 seconds before doing html again and its just boring at this point.
